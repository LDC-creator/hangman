# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Changes made in milestone 2

so far i hvae created a script that procdes a random word based on a list of fruit and then ask the user for a single letter input, check that the input is no more then one character and produce a statement based on if there input is valid or not.
